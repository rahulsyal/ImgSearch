# ImgSearch
Search engine that shows website screenshots instead of text-links. Currently shows first five results because of limitations how many ScreenshotLayer requests I could make. Uses ScreenshotLayer API to grab screenshots from a created url based on the input in the html form. Uses libcurl w/ php to web scrape search results. Created as a side project at Boston Hacks on 10/31/15.
